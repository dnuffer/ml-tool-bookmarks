### Deep Learning

* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) 

### Ensembling

* [ML-ENS](https://github.com/flennerhag/mlens) combines a Scikit-learn high-level API with a low-level computational graph framework to build memory efficient, maximally parallelized ensemble networks in as few lines of codes as possible

### Feature Selection

* [Feature Selection Tool](https://github.com/WillKoehrsen/feature-selector) is a tool for dimensionality reduction of machine learning datasets

### General ML Libraries

* [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) Simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis

### Visualization

* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) is a Python 2D plotting library provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
* [plotly](https://plot.ly/) has open source tools for composing, editing, and sharing interactive data visualization via the Web.

### Data Processing

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a library that provides data structures and data analysis tools for Python
